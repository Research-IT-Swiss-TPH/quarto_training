## üéØ Exercise objectives

-   This exercise builds on the previous exercises where you learnt to [create a simple MS Word report ‚≠ê](./exercise3_instructions.html) and to [add dynamic elements to your report ‚≠ê‚≠ê](./exercise4_instructions.html). Mastering these two exercises is essential for successfully completing this one;
-   Open your modified Quarto document `exercise4.qmd` in RStudio;
-   All text formatted in bold is a placeholder and should be replaced with appropriate automated calculations or cross-references;
-   Complete each of the following tasks and render the document after each task or set of tasks to track your progress.

## Parametrise your report

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about parameters](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/parameters.html#knitr)
-   See [Quarto documentation about rendering outputs using different parameters](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/parameters.html#rendering)
:::

-   [ ] Adjust the report to focus on data for the year 2022 only ;
-   [ ] You were unfortunately provided with a previous erroneous version of the dataset. Update the report to use the dataset stored in `df2.RData` instead of the one stored in `df1.RData` ;
-   [ ] Render 3 reports (1 report with df2.RData for the full outbreak period, 1 report with df1.RData for year 2021 only, 1 report with df2.RData for year 2021 only) adapting the following command which needs to be run in a terminal (ensure your working directory is the one where your Quarto document is stored and all file paths are correct).

```         
quarto render exercise3.qmd --out report_data1.docx -P dataset:df1.RData
```

### Discussion question

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using R within Quarto compared to using R scripts.

## Finalise your MS Word report

::: callout-tip
See [Quarto documentation about Word templates](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html)
:::

-   [ ] Apply the Swiss TPH template `swisstph_template.docx` to your MS Word rendered report ;
-   [ ] Create your own template and apply it to your MS Word rendered report.
