This exercise builds on the previous exercise where you learnt to [build a simple MS Word report ⭐](./exercise3_instructions.html).

## Objectives 🎯

-   You are tasked with generating a simple analytically reproducible report on a fictitious outbreak;
-   If you have generated the simple MS Word report as in [Exercise 3](./exercise3_instructions.html), continue working on the same Quarto notebook you already modified. Otherwise, download the files `df1.RData` and `exercise4.qmd` using the links provided on the right-hand side of this page. For simplicity, please put these two files under the same folder and open the Quarto notebook in RStudio.
-   Complete each of the following tasks and render the document after each task or set of tasks to track your progress;
-   All text formatted in bold is a placeholder and should be replaced with appropriate automated calculations or cross-references;
-   The final output should be a Microsoft (MS) Word report, containing all required tables, figures, corresponding captions and cross-references, and formatted with the Swiss TPH template.

## Improve navigation and readability

-   [ ] Insert a table of contents to the rendered MS Word document;
-   [ ] Automatically number the different sections of the rendered MS Word document;
-   [ ] Configure the table of contents to only display two levels of section headings.

::: callout-tip
-   See Quarto documentation about [table of contents](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html#table-of-contents)
:::

## Implement dynamic calculations

-   [ ] Change the date `2023-12-31` to the date at which the MS Word document was last rendered;
-   [ ] Format the date at which the MS Word document was last rendered to display it with the format `December 31, 2023`;

::: callout-tip
-   See Quarto documentation about [date formatting](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html#date-formatting)
-   See Quarto documentation about [dynamic dates](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html#date-parsing)
:::

-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with the automated calculation of the outbreak start and end dates;

> "*The outbreak ran from **date** to **date***"

-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with the automated calculation of the number of cases, confirmed cases and deaths. (Hint: We suggest to calculate these numbers in chunks in order to keep inline code short.)

> "*Over the studied period, there were **N** cases, including **N** confirmed cases and **N** confirmed deaths.*"

::: callout-tip
-   See Quarto documentation about [inline code](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html)
:::

## Reference tables

#### Table 1 {.unnumbered}

-   [ ] Assign a label to the table summarising the demographic characteristics and outcome frequency of all cases;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the table.

> "***cross-reference** provides a summary of the demographic characteristics and the outcome proportion for the overall population*"

#### Table 2 {.unnumbered}

-   [ ] Assign a label to the table summarising the demographic characteristics of individuals who died versus those who are still alive;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the table.

> "*while **cross-reference** compares the demographic characteristics of individuals who died versus those who are still alive*"

#### Table 3 {.unnumbered}

-   [ ] Assign a label to the table summarizing the odds ratios from the logistic regression model;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the table

> "The results of the logistic regression model are summarized in the formatted regression table, which is presented in **cross-reference**."

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about table cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html#cross-references)
:::

## Reference figures

#### Figure 1 {.unnumbered}

-   [ ] Assign a label to the figure;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the figure;

> "***cross-reference** illustrates the outbreak's progression, which can be divided into distinct phases.*"

-   [ ] Adjust the dimensions of the figure until you are happy with them.

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about figure cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#computations)
-   See [`fig-width` and `fig-height`](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#figure-options) options to adjust figure dimensions
:::

## Reference code chunks

-   [ ] Add a caption to the code chunk for your R implementation of the logistic regression;
-   [ ] Assign a label to the code chunk;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the code chunk.

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about code chunk cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#code-listings)
:::

## Add bibliographic references

-   [ ] Create a bibliography (BibTeX) file `my_biblio.bib` in the same folder as your Quarto notebook;
-   [ ] Link the BibTeX file by adding it to the YAML header of your Quarto notebook;
-   [ ] Add a new reference for [10.1016/S0140-6736(24)02669-2](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)02669-2) in the BibTeX file;
-   [ ] Create a new section named `Background` in your Quarto notebook, after the `Overview` section and before the `Population` section;
-   [ ] Insert the following sentence into the `Background` section, and replace the placeholder text in bold with the correct citation key from your BibTeX file.

> "***citation** describes trends in suspected and confirmed monkeypox virus cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo using epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data collected from 2010 to 2023.*"

::: callout-tip
-   You can generate the BibTeX entry from the DOI using citation management tools;
-   See [Quarto documentation about citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html) for guidance on formatting references;
- If you are not familiar with BibTeX files or programming, Quarto’s visual mode offers user-friendly tools for managing citations, allowing you to handle most of the previous steps automatically.

## Format MS Word reports with styles

-   [ ] Apply the Swiss TPH template `swisstph_template.docx` to your rendered MS Word report;
-   [ ] To go further, try creating your own custom Word template and apply it to your report to explore how MS Word styles can be personalized.

::: callout-tip
- See [Quarto documentation about Word templates](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html);
- To create a template with customized MS Word styles, you will need to start with a Quarto-rendered MS Word report. This is because not all MS Word styles are supported by Quarto, and starting from a rendered report ensures better compatibility.
