## Learning objectives ðŸŽ¯ 

1.  Create a Quarto notebook;
2.  Setup your R environment to be able to use and render Quarto documents.

## Create a new Quarto document

Quarto notebooks can be created and edited in RStudio.

::: callout-important

This is only true for RStudio v2022.07 and later. If you use older versions of RStudio on your laptop, you will not have Quarto within RStudio.

:::

In RStudio, you can create a new Quarto document by selecting

> **File** \> **New File** \> **Quarto Document...**

:::

When you create a new Quarto document, RStudio tries to be helpful by allowing you to select a template which explains the different section of an Quarto document. R Studio will enable you select options to pick from to generate a template Quarto document to start from.

The title and the author names are not important at this stage. If the output document type you want is not one of these, do not worry - you can just pick any one and change it manually later.

Let us select **HTML** to create an html document.

Click on **Create** to open up a new Quarto (`.Qmd`) document.

## Setup your R environment

You need to ensure the `knitr` and `rmarkdown` packages are available.
