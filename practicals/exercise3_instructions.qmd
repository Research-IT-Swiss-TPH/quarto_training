## Overall objective

-   You are tasked with generating a Microsoft Word report on an outbreak. Open the Quarto document `exercise3.qmd` in RStudio.
-   All text formatted in bold is a placeholder and should be replaced with appropriate automated calculations or cross-references.
-   Complete each of the following tasks and render the document after each task or set of tasks to track your progress.

## Setup basic elements of the Quarto document

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about date formatting](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html#date-formatting)
-   See [Quarto documentation about execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)
:::

-   [ ] Update the title of the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Put your name as author of the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Add the date `2023-12-31` to the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Change the output format to generate a MS Word document ;
-   [ ] Configure the Quarto document to hide code in the rendered MS Word document ;
-   [ ] Configure the Quarto document to hide warnings in the rendered MS Word document.

## Improve navigation and readability

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about MS Word table of contents](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html#table-of-contents)
:::

-   [ ] Insert a table of contents to the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Automatically number the different sections of the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Configure the table of contents to only display two levels of section headings.

## Implement dynamic calculations

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about dynamic dates](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html#date-parsing)
-   See [Quarto documentation about inline code](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html)
:::

-   [ ] Change the date `2023-12-31` to the date at which the Quarto document was last modified, and format this date to display it with the format `December 31, 2023` ;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with the automated calculation of the outbreak start and end dates ;

> "*The outbreak ran from **date** to **date***"

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with the automated calculation of the number of cases, confirmed cases and deaths.

> "*Over the studied period, there were **N** cases, including **N** confirmed cases and **N** confirmed deaths.*"

## Create and reference publication-ready tables

::: callout-tip
-   See [gtsummary documentation about summary tables](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)
-   See [Quarto documentation about table cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html#cross-references)

Other R packages include [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/) and [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)
:::

-   [ ] Create a table summarising the demographic characteristics and outcome frequency of all cases ;
-   [ ] Add a caption to the table ;
-   [ ] Assign a label to the table ;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the table ;

> "***cross-reference** provides a summary of the demographic characteristics and the outcome proportion for the overall population*"

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

-   [ ] Create a table summarising the demographic characteristics of individuals who died versus those who are still alive ;
-   [ ] Add a caption to the table ;
-   [ ] Assign a label to the table ;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the table.

> "*while **cross-reference** compares the demographic characteristics of individuals who died versus those who are still alive*"

## Customise figures

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about figure cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#computations)
-   See [Quarto documentation about figure options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#figure-options)
:::

-   [ ] Add a caption to the figure ;
-   [ ] Assign a label to the figure ;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the figure ;

> "***cross-reference** illustrates the outbreak's progression, which can be divided into distinct phases.*"

-   [ ] Adjust the dimensions of the figure until you are happy with it
-   [ ] Beautify the plot using ggplot options

## Code

::: callout-tip
-   See [gtsummary documentation about formatted table of regression model results](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_regression.html)
-   See [Quarto documentation about code chunk cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#code-listings)
:::

-   [ ] Implement a logistic regression model based on description in the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Create a table summarizing the odds ratios from the logistic regression model ;
-   [ ] Add a caption to the table ;
-   [ ] Assign a label to the table ;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the table ;

> "The results of the logistic regression model are summarized in the formatted regression table, which is presented in **cross-reference**."

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

-   [ ] Display the code chunk for your R implementation of the logistic regression (and only this code chunk) in the rendered MS Word document ;
-   [ ] Add a caption to the code chunk ;
-   [ ] Assign a label to the code chunk ;
-   [ ] Replace the placeholder text in bold with a cross-reference to the code chunk.

## Finalise your MS Word report

::: callout-tip
See [Quarto documentation about Word templates](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html)
:::

-   [ ] Apply the Swiss TPH template `swisstph_template.docx` to your MS Word rendered report ;
-   [ ] Create your own template and apply it to your MS Word rendered report.
