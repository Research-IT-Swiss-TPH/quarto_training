Complete each of the following tasks and render the document after each set of tasks to track your progress.

## Task 1

a.  Update the title of the Quarto document ;
b.  Put your name as author of the Quarto document ;
c.  Add the date `2023-12-31` to the Quarto document ;
d.  Change the output format to generate a Microsoft Word document ;
e.  Configure the Quarto document to hide code in the rendered MS Word document ;
f.  Configure the Quarto document to hide warnings in the rendered MS Word document.

c.  Automatically display the clauclated number of cases, confirmed cases and deaths within the text "Over the studied period, there were **calculation of number of cases** cases, including **calculation of number of confirmed cases** confirmed cases and **calculation of number of deaths** confirmed deaths."

## Task 6 - Parametrise your report

a.  We would like to generate 2 reports - one for the period 2021, the other one for the period 2022
b.  Actually you were given the wrong dataset. Can you reload using the dataset stored in `df2.RData` instead of `df1.RData`?

## Task 7 - Finalise the MS Word report

-   Customise the Word document with the Swiss TPH template

If you want to customize the appearance of MS Word output, Pandoc supports a special type of template called a reference document. Here is an example of specifying a custom reference document for docx:

```         
format:
  docx:
    reference-doc: custom-reference-doc.docx
```

Reference documents include sample text that uses all of the output styles used by Pandoc.

To use a reference doc template, just copy it to your document’s directory and reference it as shown above. [Use Word templates](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html)

## Task 8 - Finalise the document

-   Once you are done with all the tasks, delete all the instructions (lines 16 to 69).
