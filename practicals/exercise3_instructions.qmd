# üéØ Exercise objectives

-   You are tasked with generating a simple report on a fictitious outbreak.
-   Open the Quarto document `exercise3.qmd` in RStudio. Complete each of the following tasks and render the document after each task or set of tasks to track your progress.
-   The final output should be a Microsoft (MS) Word report named `exercise3.docx`, containing all required tables, figures and corresponding captions.

# Setup basic elements of the Quarto document

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about date formatting](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html#date-formatting)
-   See [Quarto documentation about execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)
:::

-   [ ] Update the title of the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Put your name as author of the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Add the date `2023-12-31` to the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Change the output format to generate a MS Word document ;
-   [ ] Configure the Quarto document to hide code in the rendered MS Word document ;
-   [ ] Configure the Quarto document to hide warnings in the rendered MS Word document.

# Create publication-ready tables

::: callout-tip
-   See [`gtsummary` documentation for creating formatted summary tables](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)
-   See [`gtsummary` documentation for creating formatted tables of regression model results](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_regression.html)
-   See [`tbl-cap` option](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html#computations) to add a caption to a table generated by an executable code chunk

Other R packages for working with and customising tables include [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/) and [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)
:::

-   [ ] Create a table summarising the demographic characteristics and outcome frequency of all cases ;
-   [ ] Add a caption to the table;
-   [ ] Create a table summarising the demographic characteristics of individuals who died versus those who are still alive ;
-   [ ] Add a caption to the table;
-   [ ] Implement a logistic regression model based on description in the Quarto document ;
-   [ ] Create a table summarizing the odds ratios from the logistic regression model ;
-   [ ] Add a caption to the table.

# Create publication-ready figures

::: callout-tip
-   see [`fig-cap` option](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#caption-and-alt-text) to add a caption to a figure generated by an executable code chunk
-   See [`fig-width` and `fig-height` options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#figure-options) to adjust figure dimensions
:::

-   [ ] Add a caption to the figure ;
-   [ ] Adjust the dimensions of the figure until you are happy with it;
-   [ ] Beautify the plot using `ggplot` options.

# Code visibility

-   [ ] Display the code chunk for your R implementation of the logistic regression (and only this code chunk) in the rendered MS Word document.
