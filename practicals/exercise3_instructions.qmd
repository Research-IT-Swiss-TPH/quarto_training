## Overall objective

You are tasked with generating a Microsoft Word report on an outbreak. Open the Quarto document `exercise3.qmd` in RStudio. All text formatted in bold is a placeholder and should be replaced with appropriate automated calculations or cross-references. Complete each of the following tasks and render the document after each set of tasks to track your progress.

## Task 1

::: callout-tip
-   See [Quarto documentation about date formatting](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html#date-formatting)

:::

a.  Update the title of the Quarto document ;
b.  Put your name as author of the Quarto document ;
c.  Add the date `2023-12-31` to the Quarto document ;
d.  Change the output format to generate a MS Word document ;
e.  Configure the Quarto document to hide code in the rendered MS Word document ;
f.  Configure the Quarto document to hide warnings in the rendered MS Word document.

## Improve navigation to improve readability

::: callout-tip

:::

a.  Change the date `2023-12-31` to the date at which the Quarto document was last modified, and format this date to display it with the format `December 31, 2023` ;
b.  Automatically display the calculated start and end dates of the outbreak by replacing the placeholder text in bold ;


> "*The outbreak ran from **calculation of start date** to **calculation of end date***"

c.  Automatically display the calculated number of cases, confirmed cases and deaths by replacing the placeholder text in bold ;

> "*Over the studied period, there were **calculation of number of cases** cases, including **calculation of number of confirmed cases** confirmed cases and **calculation of number of deaths** confirmed deaths*"

## Table

::: callout-tip
-   See [gtsummary documentation about summary tables](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)
-   See [Quarto documentation about table cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html#cross-references)
:::

a.  Create a table summarising the characteristics of the population with suspected cases
b.  Add a caption for the table
c.  Add a label for the table and cross-reference in the text

> "***cross-reference table** provides a summary of the overall population characteristics*"

## Figure

::: callout-tip
-   See Quarto figure cross-references
:::

a.  Add a caption for the figure
b.  Add a label for the figure and cross reference

> "***cross-reference figure** illustrates the outbreak's progression, which can be divided into distinct phases.*"

c.  Change the height of the figure
d.  Change the width of the figure
e.  Beautify the plot

## Parametrise your report

::: callout-tip
-   See
:::

a.  We would like to generate the report only for the 2022 year
b. Actually we would like to generate the report only for the 2021 year
b.  Actually you were given the wrong dataset. Can you reload using the dataset stored in `df2.RData` instead of `df1.RData`?

::: callout-important

### Question

Can you discuss the pros and cons of using R within Quarto rather than within scripts?

:::

## Finalise your MS Word report

::: callout-tip
See [Use Word templates](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html)
:::

a. Customise the Word document with the Swiss TPH template
b. Customise the Word document using your own template
