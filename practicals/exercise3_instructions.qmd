## Task 2

Make it easier for readers to navigate your document.

a.  Add a table of contents to the Quarto document.
b.  Automatically number the different sections of the Quarto document.
c.  Configure the table of contents to only display levels of section headings.

## Task 3 - Inline

-   Execute the automated calculation of the start and end dates within the text "The outbreak ran from **calculation of start date** to **calculation of end date**."
-   Execute the automated calculation of the number of cases, confirmed cases and deaths within the text "Over this period, there were **calculation of number of cases** cases, including **calculation of number of confirmed cases** confirmed cases and **calculation of number of deaths** confirmed deaths."

## Task 4 - Table

-   Create a table summarising the characteristics of the

## Task 5 - Figure

-   Change the height of the figure
-   Change the width of the figure
-   Add a caption for the figure
-   Add a label for the figure

## Task 6 - Use parameters

We would like to generate 2 reports - one for the period 2021, the other one for the period 2022

## Task 7 - Dataset

Actually you were given the wrong dataset. Can you reload using the dataset stored in `df2.RData` instead of `df1.RData`? Do you see an advantage of using Quarto over R.

## Task 8 -

-   Customise the Word document with the Swiss TPH template

If you want to customize the appearance of MS Word output, Pandoc supports a special type of template called a reference document. Here is an example of specifying a custom reference document for docx:

```         
format:
  docx:
    reference-doc: custom-reference-doc.docx
```

Reference documents include sample text that uses all of the output styles used by Pandoc.

To use a reference doc template, just copy it to your document’s directory and reference it as shown above. [Use Word templates](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word-templates.html)

## Task 9 - Finalise the document

-   Once you are done with all the tasks, delete all the instructions (lines 16 to 69).
