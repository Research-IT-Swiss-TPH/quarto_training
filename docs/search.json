Replace ‚ÄúC:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe‚Äù with the path to your desired Python executable. You can also add this permanently in your R environment variables using .Renviron.

We use the dplyr package for simplicity and display the first few rows of the data frame using knitr::kable() for formatted output.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-1\n#| tbl-cap: Data frame created, manipulated and displayed using R\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndf1 &lt;- iris |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(Sepal.Area = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width)\ndf1 |&gt;\n  head(5) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n\nTable¬†1: Data frame created, manipulated and displayed using R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\nSepal.Area\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n17.85\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n14.70\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n15.04\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n14.26\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n18.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs illustrated in Listing¬†1, you can access R objects (here the data frame df1) as a Python object by calling them through the r. prefix. In this example, we access the R data frame df1 and manipulate it in Python by creating a new column, Petal.Area. Then, use {python} as the chunk language to specify Python chunks within your Quarto notebook, enabling integration and inter-language communication.\n\n\n\nListing¬†1: Example of Python code chunk manipulating a R object\n\n```{python}\n#| lst-label: lst-1\n#| lst-cap: Example of Python code chunk manipulating a R object\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf2 = r.df1\ndf2[\"Petal.Area\"] = df2[\"Petal.Length\"] * df2[\"Petal.Width\"]\n```",

For example, R data frames are automatically converted to pandas data frames in Python, but other complex R objects may not be directly accessible in Python.\nChunk Execution Order: Run code chunks in the correct order to avoid errors due to missing objects or incomplete definitions. Use clear and consistent chunk labels for cross-referencing.\nPerformance Considerations: Keep in mind that transferring large data frames between R and Python may introduce some overhead.
