If you want these settings to apply to all output formats (like HTML or PDF), move them to a higher level in the YAML header.\nWhen you open the rendered MS Word document, you might see a warning message, as displayed below. Do not worry, this is completely normal and does not indicate an error. This message appears because the document contains dynamic fields, such as the table of contents, cross-references, or figure/table captions. Click “Yes” to ensure all references and the table of contents are properly updated. If you click “No,” the document will still open, but some fields may not reflect the latest changes. This is a standard behavior in MS Word when working with dynamic content.\n\n\nThis document contains fields that may refer to other files. Do you want to update the fields in this document?"
