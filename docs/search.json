There is only one unique header in a Quarto document and it is always surrounded by --- lines on the top and bottom of the section.\nYAML is a data format that has the form of a key: value pairing to store data. The keys in this case are title and format. The values are those that follow the key (e.g., ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù for title). These key data are used to store the settings that Quarto will use to render the output document. The keys listed above are some of many settings that Quarto has available to use.\n\n\nIn white background areas, any text will appear as regular text in the final report. This is actually a markup language, which can have formatting such as headings, italics, bold, numbers, and bullets.\n\n\nCode chunks, typically shown within gray backgrounds, execute commands in Quarto. In the example provided, R code is being run within these chunks. These commands may handle data processing, cleaning, or the generation of visual outputs that are integrated into the final document."

    "text": "6 Running R code in notebook mode\nTo write and execute code in Quarto, you will use code chunks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultilanguage\n\n\n\nAs the number of programming languages used for scientific discourse is very broad, Quarto was developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Observable JavaScript (OJS), and Julia, building on the RStudio (R) and Jupyter (Python, Julia) ecosystems which are very popular among data scientists. Stata is not a language supported by Quarto.\n\n\nYou can run R code in your Quarto document, by writing R commands within code chunks as is displayed below\n\n```{r}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n6.1 Create code chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHere are some tips for creating code chunks in RStudio\n\n\nBackticks: use three backticks to start and end a code chunk.\n\nToolbar icon: you can also start a code chunk by clicking the appropriate icon in the toolbar. \n\n\nKeyboard shortcut: for a quicker method, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Tables\nDisplaying data can be achieved with simple commands. For instance, to show the first 10 rows of the iris dataset, one can use:\n\n```{r}\niris |&gt;\n  head(10)\n```\n\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1           5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2           4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3           4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4           4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5           5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6           5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n7           4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3  setosa\n8           5.0         3.4          1.5         0.2  setosa\n9           4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2  setosa\n10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1  setosa\n\n\nTo improve the readability of tables, the knitr::kable() function provides a more structured and formatted output:\n\n```{r}\niris |&gt;\n  head(10)  |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.4\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.4\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.4\n2.9\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.1\n1.5\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAdditional R packages can be used for more advanced and aesthetically refined tables."

    "text": "7 Rendering\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.\n\nIn the case of this YAML header, the Quarto document will generate an HTML file because of the format: html setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode errors\n\n\n\nIf you attempt to render the document with code chunks that contain errors, the rendering process will fail. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that all code chunks run successfully in sequence before rendering the document.\n\n\n\n7.1 Options\nYou can add options to a specific code chunk as is shown below:\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n2 * 2\n```\nThe echo: false option hides the code chunk in the rendered output document (only code output is displayed). In this example, rendered output document will only print:\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nAdditionally, you can apply such options globally by specifying them in the YAML header, which configures settings for the entire Quarto document.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: html\neditor: visual\necho: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the YAML header is indentation-sensitive and relies on proper whitespace formatting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you may want to edit the title of your document.\n\n7.2 MS Word outputs\nYou can also render a MS Word document by modifying the global format option in the YAML header to format: docx\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: docx\neditor: visual\n---\n\n7.3 PDF outputs\nYou can also render a PDF document by modifying the global format option in the YAML header to format: pdf\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: pdf\neditor: visual\n---\nWhile PDF documents are also able to be created, they require installing LaTeX, which can sometimes be complicated to install. TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution that is easy to install with R. It is needed to compile R Markdown or Quarto documents to PDF.\nInstall the TinyTeX package:\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\n```\nTo install TinyTeX from the tinytex package, please run the R commands as follow:\n```{r}\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\nIf specific LaTeX packages (e.g., fancyhdr, lastpage, babel, tocbibind, worldflags) or styles are missing, they can be installed using the following commands:\n```{r}\ntinytex::tlmgr_install(\"fancyhdr\")\n```\n```{r}\ntinytex::parse_install(\n    text = \"! LaTeX Error: File `ulem.sty' not found.\"\n)\n```\nIn order to avoid the warning No hyphenation patterns were preloaded for the language French into the format., please consider installing the package hyphen-french\n```{r}\ntinytex::tlmgr_install(\"hyphen-french\")\n```\n\n7.4 Execute R code within the text\nInline code allows you to execute code within markdown, e.g.¬†to automatically use the most up-to-date computations in narrative. Quarto provides an inline code syntax that works across all three engines (Jupyter, Knitr and OJS).\nThe syntax for inline code is similar to code blocks, except you use a single tick (`) rather than triple ticks (```), and you can use it in the middle of markdown. Here is an example storing the variable in a code block and then print it in a sentence using inline code:\n\n```{r}\ncomment &lt;- \"AWESOME\"\n```\n\nYou can print the sentence like this:\nThis lecture is `{r} comment`!\nThe result of the commented code is the following output:\nThis lecture is AWESOME!\nInline expressions are always evaluated when rendering and previewing .qmd files."
