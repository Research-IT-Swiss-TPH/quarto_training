    "text": "This page provides a step-by-step correction for building a simple MS Word report using the Quarto notebook exercise3.qmd as a starting point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo get the most out of your learning experience, attempt to solve the exercise on your own before looking at this correction. Remember, trials and errors are an essential part of the learning process, strengthening your understanding and helping you build confidence. Take your time, experiment, and learn actively!\n\n\n\n1 Setup basic elements of the Quarto notebook\nAll the basic elements you need to setup are defined in the YAML header at the beginning of your Quarto notebook.\n---\n1title: My outbreak report\n2author: Helene Langet\n3date: 2023-12-31\n\n4format: docx\n\n5execute:\n6  echo: false\n7  warning: false\n---\n\n1\n\nUpdate the title option in the Quarto notebook. Quotation marks are optional.\n\n2\n\nSet the author option to your name. Quotation marks are optional.\n\n3\n\nAdd the date option and set it to 2023-12-31. Quotation marks are optional.\n\n4\n\nSet the format option to docx to generate a MS Word document.\n\n5\n\nAdd an execute block to customize the execution behaviour for your Quarto notebook. This block allows you to control how code, warnings, and other outputs are displayed in the rendered document.\n\n6\n\nAdd the echo option and set it to false to hide code in the rendered document.\n\n7\n\nAdd the warning option and set it to false to hide warnings in the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML indentation\n\n\n\nRemember that YAML is a whitespace-sensitive language where indentation determines the structure; tabs are not recognised for indentation. The recommended practice is therefore to use two spaces per indentation level to ensure consistency and avoid errors.\n\n\n\n\n2 Create publication-ready summary statistics tables\nCreating publication-ready tables in R often involves leveraging specialized packages. Popular options include gtsummary, gt and flextable. In what follows, we will use gtsummary which is an excellent package for creating summary statistics tables. To install it, run the command install.packages(\"gtsummary\") in your R console.\n\nTable 1\n\n```{r}\n10#| tbl-cap: Population characteristics\n\n#Table 1\n#Generate a summary table displaying population characteristics\nsubdf |&gt;                               \n8  dplyr::select(age,\n                sex,\n                bmi,\n                confirmed,\n                death) |&gt;\n9  gtsummary::tbl_summary()\n```\n\n\n8\n\nUse the dplyr::select() function to select specific columns (age, sex, bmi, confirmed, and death) from the subdf dataset.\n\n9\n\nUse the gtsummary::tbl_summary() function to create a table that summarizes the descriptive statistics of the selected variables in the whole population.\n\n10\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 65,6691\n\n\n\n\nage\n50 (35, 65)\n\n\nsex\n\n\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†1\n33,114 (50%)\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†2\n32,555 (50%)\n\n\nbmi\n29 (21, 38)\n\n\nconfirmed\n\n\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†0\n13,235 (20%)\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†1\n52,434 (80%)\n\n\ndeath\n\n\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†0\n64,455 (98%)\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†1\n1,214 (1.8%)\n\n\n\n1 Median (IQR); n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\n\n```{r}\n12#| tbl-cap: Demographic characteristics of deceased vs. alive\n\n#Table 2\n#Generate a summary table comparing the demographic characteristics\n#of individuals who died versus those who are still alive\nsubdf |&gt;                                                      \n  dplyr::select(sex,\n                age,\n                bmi,\n                death) |&gt;\n10  gtsummary::tbl_summary(by = death) |&gt;\n11  gtsummary::add_overall()\n```\n\n\n10\n\nUse the gtsummary::tbl_summary() function to create a summary table grouped by the death column, showing separate statistics for individuals who have died vs.¬†those who are still alive.\n\n11\n\nUse the gtsummary::add_overall() function to add a row to the table that shows overall summary statistics for the whole population, regardless of their death status.\n\n12\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic characteristics of deceased vs.¬†alive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nOverall, N = 65,6691\n0, N = 64,4551\n1, N = 1,2141\n\n\n\n\nsex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†1\n33,114 (50%)\n32,504 (50%)\n610 (50%)\n\n\n¬†¬†¬†¬†2\n32,555 (50%)\n31,951 (50%)\n604 (50%)\n\n\nage\n50 (35, 65)\n50 (35, 65)\n52 (37, 67)\n\n\nbmi\n29 (21, 38)\n29 (21, 38)\n34 (28, 41)\n\n\n\n1 n (%); Median (IQR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Create publication-ready figures\n\nFigure 1\n\n```{r}\n13#| fig-cap: Weekly count of all cases, confirmed cases and deaths\n14#| fig-width: 8\n15#| fig-height: 4\n\n#Figure 1 \n# Plot the weekly cases, confirmed cases and deaths\nggplot2::ggplot(weekly_data, ggplot2::aes(x = week)) +                        \n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = count,\n                                  color = \"All cases\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = confirmed_count,\n                                  color = \"Confirmed cases\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = death_count,\n                                  color = \"Confirmed deaths\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::labs(x = \"Week\",\n                y = \"Count\",\n                color = \"Legend\") +\n16  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(values = c(\"All cases\" = \"#440e54\",\n                                         \"Confirmed cases\" = \"#f8766d\",\n                                         \"Confirmed deaths\" = \"#128984\")) +\n17  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n18  ggplot2::theme(panel.grid.major.y = ggplot2::element_line(linewidth = 0.5,\n                                                            linetype = \"dashed\",\n                                                            color = \"grey\"), \n                 panel.grid.minor.y = ggplot2::element_line(linewidth = 0.5,\n                                                            linetype = \"dashed\",\n                                                            color = \"grey\"),\n19                 panel.grid.major.x = ggplot2::element_blank(),\n                 panel.grid.minor.x = ggplot2::element_blank())\n```\n\n\n13\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the fig-cap chunk option. Remove the title parameter from ggplot2::labs to avoid the repetition.\n\n14\n\nSet the width of the figure to 8 inches by using the fig-width option.

This option can also be specified globally in the YAML header of the Quarto notebook.\n\n16\n\nAssigns specific colors to each line for better distinction.\n\n17\n\nApply the ggplot2::theme_minimal() function to set a clean and simple aesthetic for the plot. This theme removes unnecessary elements such as background shading and focuses attention on the data by displaying only grid lines and axis labels.\n\n18\n\nAdd dashed lines for horizontal (major and minor) grid lines.\n\n19\n\nOmits vertical (major and minor) grid lines for a cleaner look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly count of all cases, confirmed cases and deaths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Present statistical models and results\n```{r}\n20#| echo: true\n\n#Logistic regression model\n21model &lt;- glm(death ~ bmi + age,\n23             subdf |&gt; dplyr::filter(confirmed == \"1\"),\n22             family = binomial)\n```\n\n20\n\nThe echo: true option ensures that the code chunk used to generate the logistic regression model is displayed in the rendered output, which is helpful for transparency and reproducibility.\n\n21\n\nThe glm() function fits a generalised linear model to predict death (binary outcome) from two predictors (bmi and age). The function returns a model object containing various components, such as coefficients (effects of predictors), residuals (errors), and fitted values (predicted probabilities).\n\n22\n\nSet the family argument to binomial to fit a logistic regression model. This is appropriate for binary outcomes like death, as it models the probability of the outcome occurring using a logit (log-odds) function (i.e.¬†coefficients represent the effect size of each predictor on the log-odds of the binary outcome).\n\n23\n\nFilter data using the dplyr::filter() function to subset the dataset so that the model is estimated from confirmed cases only.\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n```{r}\n26#| tbl-cap: Formatted regression table\n\n#Table 3\n24gtsummary::tbl_regression(model,\n25                          exponentiate = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n24\n\nUse gtsummary::tbl_regression() to create a table summary of the logistic regression results.\n\n25\n\nSet the exponentiate argument to TRUE to convert the coefficients (log-odds) into odds ratios, which are more interpretable and useful for understanding the strength of associations.\n\n26\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormatted regression table\n\n\nCharacteristic\nOR1\n95% CI1\np-value\n\n\n\n\nbmi\n1.04\n1.03, 1.04\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nage\n1.00\n1.00, 1.01\n0.003\n\n\n\n1 OR = Odds Ratio, CI = Confidence Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC-BY"

There is only one unique header in a Quarto document and it is always surrounded by --- lines on the top and bottom of the section.\nYAML is a data format that has the form of a key: value pairing to store data. The keys in this case are title and format. The values are those that follow the key (e.g., ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù for title). These key data are used to store the settings that Quarto will use to render the output document. The keys listed above are some of many settings that Quarto has available to use.\n\n\nIn white background areas, any text will appear as regular text in the final report. This is actually a markup language, which can have formatting such as headings, italics, bold, numbers, and bullets.\n\n\nCode chunks, typically shown within gray backgrounds, execute commands in Quarto. In the example provided, R code is being run within these chunks. These commands may handle data processing, cleaning, or the generation of visual outputs that are integrated into the final document.",

Stata is not a language supported by Quarto.\n\n\nYou can run R code in your Quarto document, by writing R commands within code chunks as is displayed below\n\n```{r}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n3.1 Create code chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHere are some tips for creating code chunks in RStudio\n\nBackticks: use three backticks to start and end a code chunk.\nToolbar icon: you can also start a code chunk by clicking the appropriate icon in the toolbar. \nKeyboard shortcut: for a quicker method, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Tables\nDisplaying data can be achieved with simple commands. For instance, to show the first 10 rows of the iris dataset, one can use:\n\n```{r}\niris |&gt;\n  head(10)\n```\n\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1           5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2           4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3           4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4           4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5           5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6           5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n7           4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3  setosa\n8           5.0         3.4          1.5         0.2  setosa\n9           4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2  setosa\n10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1  setosa\n\n\nTo improve the readability of tables, the knitr::kable() function provides a more structured and formatted output:\n\n```{r}\niris |&gt;\n  head(10)  |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.4\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.4\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.4\n2.9\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.1\n1.5\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAdditional R packages can be used for more advanced and aesthetically refined tables.",

In this example, rendered output document will only print:\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nAdditionally, you can apply such options globally by specifying them in the YAML header, which configures settings for the entire Quarto document.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: html\neditor: visual\necho: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIndentation is essential for defining the structure of YAML contents. It is important to note that tabulations are not recognised as valid indentation, but the YAML language is whitespace-sensitive. The recommended practice is therefore to use two spaces per indentation level to ensure consistency and avoid errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you may want to edit the title of your document.\n\n\n4.2 MS Word outputs\nYou can also render a MS Word document by modifying the global format option in the YAML header to format: docx\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: docx\neditor: visual\n---\n\n\n4.3 PDF outputs\nYou can also render a PDF document by modifying the global format option in the YAML header to format: pdf\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: pdf\neditor: visual\n---\nWhile PDF documents are also able to be created, they require installing LaTeX, which can sometimes be complicated to install. TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution that is easy to install with R. It is needed to compile R Markdown or Quarto documents to PDF.\nInstall the TinyTeX package, and install TinyTeX from the tinytex package:\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\nIf specific LaTeX packages (e.g., fancyhdr, lastpage, babel, tocbibind, worldflags) or styles are missing, they can be installed using the following commands:\n```{r}\ntinytex::tlmgr_install(\"fancyhdr\")\n```\n```{r}\ntinytex::parse_install(\n    text = \"! LaTeX Error: File `ulem.sty' not found.\"\n)\n```\nIn order to avoid the warning No hyphenation patterns were preloaded for the language French into the format., please consider installing the package hyphen-french\n```{r}\ntinytex::tlmgr_install(\"hyphen-french\")\n```\n\n\n4.4 Execute R code within the text\nInline code allows you to execute code within markdown, e.g.¬†to automatically use the most up-to-date computations in narrative. Quarto provides an inline code syntax that works across all three engines (Jupyter, Knitr and OJS).\nThe syntax for inline code is similar to code blocks, except you use a single tick (`) rather than triple ticks (```), and you can use it in the middle of markdown. Here is an example storing the variable in a code block and then print it in a sentence using inline code:\n\n```{r}\ncomment &lt;- \"AWESOME\"\n```\n\nYou can print the sentence like this:\nThis lecture is `{r} comment`!\nThe result of the commented code is the following output:\nThis lecture is AWESOME!\nInline expressions are always evaluated when rendering and previewing .qmd files.\n\nChunk Execution Order: Run code chunks in the correct order to avoid errors due to missing objects or incomplete definitions. Use clear and consistent chunk labels for cross-referencing.",

You can install Python packages (e.g., the pandas package, which we will need later in this page) using the function py_install() in your R console:\n\nreticulate::py_install(\"pandas\")\n\n\n\n2.4 Use of a specific Python executable\nYou can also use an alternate Python executable ‚Äì if you already have one installed on your computer ‚Äì by using the command use_python():\n\n1reticulate::use_python(\"C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe\")\n\n\n1\n\nReplace \"C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe\" with the path to your Python executable.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure that R uses the correct Python executable, specify its path in the RETICULATE_PYTHON environment variable using the Sys.setenv() function. This is especially important if you have multiple Python installations on your system (e.g.¬†those activated within Conda environments).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nConsistently using the same Python environment in reticulate helps preventing version conflicts and package incompatibilities.\nTo determine the location of your Python executable on Windows, you can open a command prompt, type the command where python, then press Enter.\nNote that you can also set environment variables permanently in R or Quarto by defining them in files that allow you to store key-value pairs, such as RETICULATE_PYTHON=\"C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe\":\n\nthe _environment file that Quarto loads automatically before rendering - see Quarto documentation;\nthe .Renviron file that R loads automatically at the start of each session and applied for R scripts or Quarto notebooks. To open and edit your .Renviron file, you can use the edit_r_environ() function from the usethis package:\n\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ()",

For some situations this might be magical and useful, but when going deeper, it might be frustrating that a lot of objects are not compatible. We need to be very cautious when using this.\n10

Quotation marks are optional.\n\n2\n\nSet the author option to your name. Quotation marks are optional.\n\n3\n\nAdd the date option and set it to 2023-12-31. Quotation marks are optional.\n\n4\n\nSet the format option to docx to generate a MS Word document.\n\n5\n\nAdd an execute block to customize the execution behaviour for your Quarto notebook. This block allows you to control how code, warnings, and other outputs are displayed in the rendered document.\n\n6\n\nAdd the echo option and set it to false to hide code in the rendered document.\n\n7\n\nAdd the warning option and set it to false to hide warnings in the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML indentation\n\n\n\nRemember that YAML is a whitespace-sensitive language where indentation determines the structure; tabs are not recognised for indentation. The recommended practice is therefore to use two spaces per indentation level to ensure consistency and avoid errors.\n\n\n\n\n2 Create publication-ready summary statistics tables\nCreating publication-ready tables in R often involves leveraging specialized packages. Popular options include gtsummary, gt and flextable. In what follows, we will use gtsummary which is an excellent package for creating summary statistics tables. To install it, run the command install.packages(\"gtsummary\") in your R console.\n\nTable 1\n\n```{r}\n10#| tbl-cap: Population characteristics\n\n#Table 1\n#Generate a summary table displaying population characteristics\nsubdf |&gt;                               \n8  dplyr::select(age,\n                sex,\n                bmi,\n                confirmed,\n                death) |&gt;\n9  gtsummary::tbl_summary()\n```\n\n\n8\n\nUse the dplyr::select() function to select specific columns (age, sex, bmi, confirmed, and death) from the subdf dataset.\n\n9\n\nUse the gtsummary::tbl_summary() function to create a table that summarizes the descriptive statistics of the selected variables in the whole population.\n\n10\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\n\n```{r}\n12#| tbl-cap: Demographic characteristics of deceased vs. alive\n\n#Table 2\n#Generate a summary table comparing the demographic characteristics of individuals who died versus those who are still alive\nsubdf |&gt;                                                      \n  dplyr::select(sex,\n                age,\n                bmi,\n                death) |&gt;\n10  gtsummary::tbl_summary(by = death) |&gt;\n11  gtsummary::add_overall()\n```\n\n\n10\n\nUse the gtsummary::tbl_summary() function to create a summary table grouped by the death column, showing separate statistics for individuals who have died vs.¬†those who are still alive.\n\n11\n\nUse the gtsummary::add_overall() function to add a row to the table that shows overall summary statistics for the whole population, regardless of their death status.\n\n12\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Create publication-ready figures\n\nFigure 1\n\n```{r}\n13#| fig-cap: Weekly count of all cases, confirmed cases and deaths\n14#| fig-width: 8\n15#| fig-height: 4\n\n#Figure 1 \n# Plot the weekly cases, confirmed cases and deaths\nggplot2::ggplot(weekly_data, ggplot2::aes(x = week)) +                        \n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = count,\n                                  color = \"All cases\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = confirmed_count,\n                                  color = \"Confirmed cases\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = death_count,\n                                  color = \"Confirmed deaths\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::labs(x = \"Week\",\n                y = \"Count\",\n                color = \"Legend\") +\n16  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(values = c(\"All cases\" = \"#440e54\",\n                                         \"Confirmed cases\" = \"#f8766d\",\n                                         \"Confirmed deaths\" = \"#128984\")) +\n17  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n18  ggplot2::theme(panel.grid.major.y = ggplot2::element_line(linewidth = 0.5,\n                                                            linetype = \"dashed\",\n                                                            color = \"grey\"), \n                 panel.grid.minor.y = ggplot2::element_line(linewidth = 0.5,\n                                                            linetype = \"dashed\",\n                                                            color = \"grey\"),\n19                 panel.grid.major.x = ggplot2::element_blank(),\n                 panel.grid.minor.x = ggplot2::element_blank())\n```\n\n\n13\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the fig-cap chunk option. Remove the title parameter from ggplot2::labs to avoid the repetition.\n\n14\n\nSet the width of the figure to 8 inches by using the fig-width option. This option can also be specified globally in the YAML header of the Quarto notebook.\n\n15\n\nSet the height of the figure to 4 inches by using the fig-height option. This option can also be specified globally in the YAML header of the Quarto notebook.\n\n16\n\nAssigns specific colors to each line for better distinction.\n\n17\n\nApply the ggplot2::theme_minimal() function to set a clean and simple aesthetic for the plot. This theme removes unnecessary elements such as background shading and focuses attention on the data by displaying only grid lines and axis labels.\n\n18\n\nAdd dashed lines for horizontal (major and minor) grid lines.\n\n19\n\nOmits vertical (major and minor) grid lines for a cleaner look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly count of all cases, confirmed cases and deaths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Present statistical models and results\n```{r}\n20#| echo: true\n\n#Logistic regression model\n21model &lt;- glm(death ~ bmi + age,\n23             subdf |&gt; dplyr::filter(confirmed == \"1\"),\n22             family = binomial)\n```\n\n20\n\nThe echo: true option ensures that the code chunk used to generate the logistic regression model is displayed in the rendered output, which is helpful for transparency and reproducibility.\n\n21\n\nThe glm() function fits a generalised linear model to predict death (binary outcome) from two predictors (bmi and age). The function returns a model object containing various components, such as coefficients (effects of predictors), residuals (errors), and fitted values (predicted probabilities).\n\n22\n\nSet the family argument to binomial to fit a logistic regression model. This is appropriate for binary outcomes like death, as it models the probability of the outcome occurring using a logit (log-odds) function (i.e.¬†coefficients represent the effect size of each predictor on the log-odds of the binary outcome).\n\n23\n\nFilter data using the dplyr::filter() function to subset the dataset so that the model is estimated from confirmed cases only.\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n```{r}\n26#| tbl-cap: Formatted regression table\n\n#Table 3\n24gtsummary::tbl_regression(model,\n25                          exponentiate = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n24\n\nUse gtsummary::tbl_regression() to create a table summary of the logistic regression results.\n\n25\n\nSet the exponentiate argument to TRUE to convert the coefficients (log-odds) into odds ratios, which are more interpretable and useful for understanding the strength of associations.\n\n26\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC-BY"
