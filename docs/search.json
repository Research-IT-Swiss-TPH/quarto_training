For some situations this might be magical and useful, but when going deeper, it might be frustrating that a lot of objects are not compatible.

    "text": "3 Running R code in notebook mode\nTo write and execute code in Quarto, you will use code chunks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultilanguage\n\n\n\nAs the number of programming languages used for scientific discourse is very broad, Quarto was developed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Observable JavaScript (OJS), and Julia, building on the RStudio (R) and Jupyter (Python, Julia) ecosystems which are very popular among data scientists. Stata is not a language supported by Quarto.\n\n\nYou can run R code in your Quarto document, by writing R commands within code chunks as is displayed below\n\n```{r}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n3.1 Create code chunks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHere are some tips for creating code chunks in RStudio\n\nBackticks: use three backticks to start and end a code chunk.\nToolbar icon: you can also start a code chunk by clicking the appropriate icon in the toolbar. \nKeyboard shortcut: for a quicker method, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Tables\nDisplaying data can be achieved with simple commands. For instance, to show the first 10 rows of the iris dataset, one can use:\n\n```{r}\niris |&gt;\n  head(10)\n```\n\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1           5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2           4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3           4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4           4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5           5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6           5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n7           4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3  setosa\n8           5.0         3.4          1.5         0.2  setosa\n9           4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2  setosa\n10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1  setosa\n\n\nTo improve the readability of tables, the knitr::kable() function provides a more structured and formatted output:\n\n```{r}\niris |&gt;\n  head(10)  |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.4\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.4\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.4\n2.9\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.1\n1.5\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAdditional R packages can be used for more advanced and aesthetically refined tables.",

Therefore, it is essential to ensure that all code chunks run successfully in sequence before rendering the document.\n\n\n\n4.1 Options\nYou can add options to a specific code chunk as is shown below:\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n2 * 2\n```\nThe echo: false option hides the code chunk in the rendered output document (only code output is displayed). In this example, rendered output document will only print:\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nAdditionally, you can apply such options globally by specifying them in the YAML header, which configures settings for the entire Quarto document.\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: html\neditor: visual\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIndentation is essential for defining the structure of YAML contents. It is important to note that tabulations are not recognised as valid indentation, but the YAML language is whitespace-sensitive. The recommended practice is therefore to use two spaces per indentation level to ensure consistency and avoid errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you may want to edit the title of your document.\n\n\n4.2 MS Word outputs\nYou can also render a MS Word document by modifying the global format option in the YAML header to format: docx\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: docx\neditor: visual\n---\n\n\n4.3 PDF outputs\nYou can also render a PDF document by modifying the global format option in the YAML header to format: pdf\n---\ntitle: \"Quarto training for R - Exercise 2\"\nauthor: Unknown author\nformat: pdf\neditor: visual\n---\nWhile PDF documents are also able to be created, they require installing LaTeX, which can sometimes be complicated to install. TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution that is easy to install with R. It is needed to compile R Markdown or Quarto documents to PDF.\nInstall the TinyTeX package, and install TinyTeX from the tinytex package:\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\nIf specific LaTeX packages (e.g., fancyhdr, lastpage, babel, tocbibind, worldflags) or styles are missing, they can be installed using the following commands:\n```{r}\ntinytex::tlmgr_install(\"fancyhdr\")\n```\n```{r}\ntinytex::parse_install(\n    text = \"! LaTeX Error: File `ulem.sty' not found.\"\n)\n```\nIn order to avoid the warning No hyphenation patterns were preloaded for the language French into the format., please consider installing the package hyphen-french\n```{r}\ntinytex::tlmgr_install(\"hyphen-french\")\n```\n\n\n4.4 Execute R code within the text\nInline code allows you to execute code within markdown, e.g. to automatically use the most up-to-date computations in narrative. Quarto provides an inline code syntax that works across all three engines (Jupyter, Knitr and OJS).\nThe syntax for inline code is similar to code blocks, except you use a single tick (`) rather than triple ticks (```), and you can use it in the middle of markdown. Here is an example storing the variable in a code block and then print it in a sentence using inline code:\n\n```{r}\ncomment &lt;- \"AWESOME\"\n```\n\nYou can print the sentence like this:\nThis lecture is `{r} comment`!\nThe result of the commented code is the following output:\nThis lecture is AWESOME!\nInline expressions are always evaluated when rendering and previewing .qmd files.\n\nChunk Execution Order: Run code chunks in the correct order to avoid errors due to missing objects or incomplete definitions. Use clear and consistent chunk labels for cross-referencing.",

They use markup elements to define how text should be displayed or printed.\n\n\n\n3.0.1 HTML\nHTML is used to structure content on the web.\n\n\n&lt;b&gt;This text will be displayed in bold&lt;/b&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0.2 LaTeX\nLaTeX is used for academic and technical documents.\n\n\n\\textbf{This text will be displayed in bold}\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0.3 Markdown\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language.\n\n\n**This text will be displayed in bold**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent programming languages allow us to execute code to generate results or perform tasks.\n\n\n\n3.0.4 R\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata.frame(country=c(\"Nigeria\",\"Kenya\",\"India\"), prevalence=c(14.5,9.2,3.5)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=country, y=prevalence)) +\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", fill=\"steelblue\")\n```\n\n\n\n3.0.5 Python\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(reticulate)\nSys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = \"C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe\")\n```\n\n```{python}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.bar(['Nigeria', 'Kenya', 'India'], [14.5, 9.2, 3.5], color='steelblue')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n\n\n3.0.6 Observable JS\n```{ojs}\nBarChart({x: [\"Nigeria\", \"Kenya\", \"India\"], y: [14.5, 9.2, 3.5], yLabel: \"Prevalence (%)\"})\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output from executing code often results in visualizations or printed results. Below are the corresponding outputs for each language:\n\n\n\n\n\nCall:  glm(formula = confirmed ~ age, family = binomial, data = df)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          age  \n   1.312275     0.001292  \n\nDegrees of Freedom: 65668 Total (i.e. Null);  65667 Residual\nNull Deviance:      66000 \nResidual Deviance: 66000    AIC: 66000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc1\nc2\n\n\n\nsetosa\n5.1\n\n\nsetosa\n4.9\n\n\nsetosa\n4.7\n\n\nsetosa\n4.6\n\n\nsetosa\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocuments can be rendered in different type of outputs e.g., MS Word, PDF, HTML, PowerPoint, etc.\nPandoc is a powerful open-source tool that enables seamless conversion between various document formats, making it an essential resource for working with markup languages like Markdown, HTML, and LaTeX. By using Pandoc, you can easily transform a document written in one markup language into a wide range of output formats, including MS Word, PDF, HTML, PowerPoint, and more, without needing to manually adjust formatting or structure. This versatility makes Pandoc particularly valuable in workflows that involve literate programming, where formatted text, code commands, and outputs are integrated. Pandoc also supports templates and extensions, allowing users to customize the output to meet specific stylistic or formatting requirements, simplifying the process of producing polished, professional documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Artwork by Allison Horst.",

The engine takes the code chunks written in a specific programming language (e.g., R, Python, or Julia), runs them, and returns the output, which is then incorporated into the rendered document.\nBoth knitr and Jupyter serve as engines to execute code embedded within a document, but they work in different programming environments.\n\n\nknitr\nJuypter\n\n\n\nThis R package will read the code chunks, execute it, and ‘knit’ it back into the document.

There is only one unique header in a Quarto notebook and it is always surrounded by --- lines on the top and bottom of the section.\nYAML is a data format that has the form of a key: value pairing to store data. The keys in this case are title and format; they are are some of many settings that Quarto has available to use. The values are those that follow the key (e.g., “Untitled” for title). These key data are used to store the settings that Quarto will use to render the output document.\nMore HTML options: HTML Options\n\n\nIn white background areas, you find Markdown text which will appear as regular text in the rendered document.\n\nMarkdown is actually a markup language, which can have formatting such as headings, italics, bold, numbers, and bullets.\n\n\nCode chunks, typically shown within gray backgrounds, execute commands in Quarto.\n\nIn the example provided, R code is being run and identified with the {r} tag.

Remember, trials and errors are an essential part of the learning process, strengthening your understanding and helping you build confidence. Take your time, experiment, and learn actively!\n\n\n\n1 Setup basic elements of the Quarto notebook\nAll the basic elements you need to setup are defined in the YAML header at the beginning of your Quarto notebook.\n---\n1title: My outbreak report\n2author: Helene Langet\n3date: 2023-12-31\n\n4format: docx\n\n5execute:\n6  echo: false\n7  warning: false\n---\n\n1\n\nUpdate the title option in the Quarto notebook.

Quotation marks are optional.\n\n4\n\nSet the format option to docx to generate a MS Word document.\n\n5\n\nAdd an execute block to customize the execution behaviour for your Quarto notebook. This block allows you to control how code, warnings, and other outputs are displayed in the rendered document.\n\n6\n\nAdd the echo option and set it to false to hide code in the rendered document.\n\n7\n\nAdd the warning option and set it to false to hide warnings in the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML indentation\n\n\n\nRemember that YAML is a whitespace-sensitive language where indentation determines the structure; tabs are not recognised for indentation. The recommended practice is therefore to use two spaces per indentation level to ensure consistency and avoid errors.\n\n\n\n\n2 Create publication-ready summary statistics tables\nCreating publication-ready tables in R often involves leveraging specialized packages. Popular options include gtsummary, gt and flextable. In what follows, we will use gtsummary which is an excellent package for creating summary statistics tables. To install it, run the command install.packages(\"gtsummary\") in your R console.\n\nTable 1\n\n```{r}\n10#| tbl-cap: Population characteristics\n\n#Table 1\n#Generate a summary table displaying population characteristics\nsubdf |&gt;                               \n8  dplyr::select(age,\n                sex,\n                bmi,\n                confirmed,\n                death) |&gt;\n9  gtsummary::tbl_summary()\n```\n\n\n8\n\nUse the dplyr::select() function to select specific columns (age, sex, bmi, confirmed, and death) from the subdf dataset.\n\n9\n\nUse the gtsummary::tbl_summary() function to create a table that summarizes the descriptive statistics of the selected variables in the whole population.\n\n10\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN = 65,6691\n\n\n\n\nage\n50 (35, 65)\n\n\nsex\n\n\n\n\n    1\n33,114 (50%)\n\n\n    2\n32,555 (50%)\n\n\nbmi\n29 (21, 38)\n\n\nconfirmed\n\n\n\n\n    0\n13,235 (20%)\n\n\n    1\n52,434 (80%)\n\n\ndeath\n\n\n\n\n    0\n64,455 (98%)\n\n\n    1\n1,214 (1.8%)\n\n\n\n1 Median (IQR); n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2\n\n```{r}\n12#| tbl-cap: Demographic characteristics of deceased vs. alive\n\n#Table 2\n#Generate a summary table comparing the demographic characteristics\n#of individuals who died versus those who are still alive\nsubdf |&gt;                                                      \n  dplyr::select(sex,\n                age,\n                bmi,\n                death) |&gt;\n10  gtsummary::tbl_summary(by = death) |&gt;\n11  gtsummary::add_overall()\n```\n\n\n10\n\nUse the gtsummary::tbl_summary() function to create a summary table grouped by the death column, showing separate statistics for individuals who have died vs. those who are still alive.\n\n11\n\nUse the gtsummary::add_overall() function to add a row to the table that shows overall summary statistics for the whole population, regardless of their death status.\n\n12\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the tbl-cap chunk option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic characteristics of deceased vs. alive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nOverall, N = 65,6691\n0, N = 64,4551\n1, N = 1,2141\n\n\n\n\nsex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    1\n33,114 (50%)\n32,504 (50%)\n610 (50%)\n\n\n    2\n32,555 (50%)\n31,951 (50%)\n604 (50%)\n\n\nage\n50 (35, 65)\n50 (35, 65)\n52 (37, 67)\n\n\nbmi\n29 (21, 38)\n29 (21, 38)\n34 (28, 41)\n\n\n\n1 n (%); Median (IQR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Create publication-ready figures\n\nFigure 1\n\n```{r}\n13#| fig-cap: Weekly count of all cases, confirmed cases and deaths\n\n#Figure 1\n# Aggregate the data to get the weekly count of all cases, confirmed cases and deaths\nweekly_data &lt;- subdf |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(week) |&gt;\n  dplyr::summarise(count = dplyr::n(),\n                   confirmed_count = sum(confirmed == \"1\"),\n                   death_count = sum(death == \"1\"))\n\n# Plot the weekly cases, confirmed cases and deaths\nggplot2::ggplot(weekly_data, ggplot2::aes(x = week)) +                        \n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = count,\n                                  color = \"All cases\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = confirmed_count,\n                                  color = \"Confirmed cases\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line(ggplot2::aes(y = death_count,\n                                  color = \"Confirmed deaths\"),\n                     size = 1) +\n  ggplot2::labs(x = \"Week\",\n                y = \"Count\",\n                color = \"Legend\") +\n14  ggplot2::scale_color_manual(values = c(\"All cases\" = \"#440e54\",\n                                         \"Confirmed cases\" = \"#f8766d\",\n                                         \"Confirmed deaths\" = \"#128984\")) +\n15  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n16  ggplot2::theme(panel.grid.major.y = ggplot2::element_line(linewidth = 0.5,\n                                                            linetype = \"dashed\",\n                                                            color = \"grey\"), \n                 panel.grid.minor.y = ggplot2::element_line(linewidth = 0.5,\n                                                            linetype = \"dashed\",\n                                                            color = \"grey\"),\n17                 panel.grid.major.x = ggplot2::element_blank(),\n                 panel.grid.minor.x = ggplot2::element_blank())\n```\n\n\n13\n\nAdd a caption to the table by using the fig-cap chunk option.

    "section": "2 Setup your R environment",
    "text": "2 Setup your R environment\nTo integrate Python within a Quarto notebook that primarily uses R code chunks (i.e., executed with the knitr engine), you will need the reticulate R package, which serves as a bridge between R and Python, allowing you to run Python code chunks alongside R and share objects between the two programming languages. This setup provides a powerful approach for combining R’s statistical capabilities with Python’s data manipulation and machine learning tools, enabling a robust, mixed-language workflow within Quarto.\n\n2.1 Install and load reticulate\n\n\nIf it is not already done, install the reticulate package using the function install.packages() in your R console:\n\ninstall.packages(\"reticulate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad reticulate at the beginning of your Quarto notebook.\n\nlibrary(reticulate)\n\n\n\n2.2 Verify your Python version\nUse py_config() to verify what Python version is active. This also allows you to confirm that required Python packages are available within your chosen environment. By default, reticulate uses an isolated python virtual environment named r-reticulate.\n\nreticulate::py_config()\n\nError in python_config_impl(python) : \n  Error running \"C:/Users/langhe/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/python310.dll.exe\": No such file.\nError in python_config_impl(python) : \n  Error running \"C:/Users/langhe/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/python310.dll.exe\": No such file.\n\n\npython:         C:/Users/langhe/Documents/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/Scripts/python.exe\nlibpython:      C:/Users/langhe/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/python310.dll\npythonhome:     C:/Users/langhe/Documents/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate\nversion:        3.10.16 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Dec  5 2024, 14:07:43) [MSC v.1942 64 bit (AMD64)]\nArchitecture:   64bit\nnumpy:          C:/Users/langhe/Documents/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/Lib/site-packages/numpy\nnumpy_version:  2.2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the r-reticulate does not exist, you can try to remove and recreate this environment using the following commands in your R console:\n\nreticulate::virtualenv_remove(\"r-reticulate\", confirm = TRUE)\nreticulate::virtualenv_create(\"r-reticulate\")\n\nIf you encounter issues setting up your Python environment, please let us know as this is usually the tricky part of the process.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Install Python packages to your active reticulate environment\nPython packages will be installed in the active Python environment as set by the RETICULATE_PYTHON_ENV environment variable. If this variable is unset, then the r-reticulate environment will be used. You can install Python packages (e.g., the pandas package, which we will need later in this page) using the function py_install() in your R console:\n\nreticulate::py_install(\"pandas\")\n\n\n\n2.4 Use of a specific Python executable\nYou can also use an alternate Python executable – if you already have one installed on your computer – by using the command use_python():\n\n1reticulate::use_python(\"C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe\")\n\n\n1\n\nReplace \"C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe\" with the path to your Python executable.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure that R uses the correct Python executable, specify its path in the RETICULATE_PYTHON environment variable using the Sys.setenv() function. This is especially important if you have multiple Python installations on your system (e.g. those activated within Conda environments).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nConsistently using the same Python environment in reticulate helps preventing version conflicts and package incompatibilities.\nTo determine the location of your Python executable on Windows, you can open a command prompt, type the command where python, then press Enter.\nNote that you can also set environment variables permanently in R or Quarto by defining them in files that allow you to store key-value pairs, such as RETICULATE_PYTHON=\"C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/python.exe\":\n\nthe _environment file that Quarto loads automatically before rendering - see Quarto documentation;\nthe .Renviron file that R loads automatically at the start of each session and applied for R scripts or Quarto notebooks. To open and edit your .Renviron file, you can use the edit_r_environ() function from the usethis package:\n\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ()",
