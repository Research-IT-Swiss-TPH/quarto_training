## Learning objectives üéØ

1. Understand the structure of the Quarto notebook
2. Understand the difference and relationships between notebooks and rendered documents

## Quarto notebooks vs. rendered documents

A Quarto notebook and its corresponding rendered document(s) serve different purposes but are closely connected. 

- The **Quarto notebook** is the **source document** where content is defined.
- The **rendered document** is the **output** generated from the Quarto notebook. Common rendered document formats include:
    - HTML for interactive web-based reports.
    - PDF for professional and printable documents.
    - Word for editable text-based outputs.
    
A single Quarto notebook can be rendered into multiple formats. While there may be some limitations when targeting different formats, this flexibility is one of Quarto's core strengths, making it a powerful tool for creating versatile and reusable documents.

## Structure of a Quarto notebook

There are three basic components to a Quarto notebook: 

- a unique (YAML) header,
- (markdown) text areas, and
- code areas (and their output).

### Header

At the top of the Quarto notebook, you will see something that looks as follows:

![](../images/notebook_structure_header.png)

This section is called the **YAML header** and it contains commands and metadata about the Quarto notebook. There is only one unique header in a Quarto notebook and it is always surrounded by `---` lines on the top and bottom of the section.

YAML is a data format that has the form of a **key: value pairing** to store data. The keys in this case are *title* and *format*; they are are some of many settings that Quarto has available to use. The values are those that follow the key (e.g., ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù for *title*). These key data are used to store the settings that Quarto will use to render the output document.

### Text areas

In white background areas, you find **Markdown text** which will appear as regular text in the rendered document.

Markdown is actually a markup language, which can have formatting such as headings, italics, bold, numbers, and bullets.

### Code areas

Code chunks, typically shown within gray backgrounds, execute commands in Quarto.

In the example provided, R code is being run and identified with the **{r}** tag. These commands may handle data processing, cleaning, or the generation of visual outputs that are integrated into the final document.

## Structure of a rendered document

The rendered document translates the notebook's structure, content, and code outputs into a polished, static format for presentation or sharing.
