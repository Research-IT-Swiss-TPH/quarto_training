## Learning objectives üéØ

1. Understand the structure of the Quarto notebook
2. Understand the difference and relationships between notebooks and rendered documents

## Quarto notebooks vs. rendered documents

A Quarto notebook and its corresponding rendered document(s) serve different purposes but are closely connected. 

- The **Quarto notebook** is the **source document** where content is defined.
- The **rendered document** is the **output** generated from the Quarto notebook. Common rendered document formats include:
    - HTML for interactive web-based reports.
    - PDF for professional and printable documents.
    - Word for editable text-based outputs.

## Structure of a Quarto notebook

There are three basic components to a Quarto document: a header, markdown text and code.

### Header

At the top of the Quarto notebook, you will see something that looks as follows:

```{.yaml}         
---
title: "Untitled"
format: html
---
```

This section is called the **YAML header** and it contains commands and metadata about the Quarto document. There is only one unique header in a Quarto document and it is always surrounded by `---` lines on the top and bottom of the section.

YAML is a data format that has the form of a **key: value pairing** to store data. The keys in this case are *title* and *format*; they are are some of many settings that Quarto has available to use. The values are those that follow the key (e.g., ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù for *title*). These key data are used to store the settings that Quarto will use to render the output document.

### Markdown text

In white background areas, any text will appear as regular text in the final report. This is actually a markup language, which can have formatting such as headings, italics, bold, numbers, and bullets.

### Code

Code chunks, typically shown within gray backgrounds, execute commands in Quarto. In the example provided, R code is being run within these chunks. These commands may handle data processing, cleaning, or the generation of visual outputs that are integrated into the final document.

## Structure of a rendered document

The rendered document translates the notebook's structure, content, and code outputs into a polished, static format for presentation or sharing.
